# Lazy Shortcuts for Minecraft Bedrock
![Alt text](media/logo.png "Logo")

This is an addon that simplifies some things I commonly do in Minecraft.
It's not really meant to change the game so much as simplify the more grindy elements of the game.
## Implemented
### Added Functionality

- **Copper Tools/Armor**: Just a pleasant alternative to stone/leather in the early game.
- **Kelp Generator**: Generates kelp at regular intervals. 
    - Avoid the complexity of zero-tick kelp/XP farms.
    - Right-click/interact to turn on/off
- **Zombie Spawner**: Generates zombies at regular intervals.
    - Can only be placed on existing mob spawners.
    - Beefs up the efficiency of mob spawner farms, and works around a 1.18 bug where mob spawners don't work.
    - Right-click/interact to turn on/off
- **Flood Light**: Much brighter than a normal torch
    - Fills surrounding air blocks with ambient light
    - Useful for lighting up giant caverns
- **More Cats**:
    - Gray Tabby (unused content from vanilla RP)
    - Purple and Blue cats (my nieces' favorite colors)
    - Nyan Cat (just because)


### Recipes for Existing Stuff
- **Trident Recipe**: `Tridents` are scarce early game and abundant late game. This makes them a bit easier to acquire.
- **Saddle Recipe**: `Saddles` are scarce early game (when you need them) and abundant later (when you don't).
- **Quartz Recipe**: Convert your `quartz_blocks` back into `quartz`! This was a dumb "[feature](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360043032171-Quartz-Block-to-Nether-Quartz)" anyway.
- **Scute Recipe**: Save some time waiting for eggs to hatch and baby turtles to grow.
- **Creeper Spawn Egg**: Turn a mob spawner into your very own gunpowder farm.
- **Zombie Villager Spawn Egg**: Easily build your trading hall, with discounts.
- **Dragon Egg**: Duplicate the Ender Dragon egg, so you can fight the dragon countless times.
- Smelt leather components down to `rabbit_hide` via furnace.
