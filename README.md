# Lazy Shortcuts for Minecraft Bedrock
![Alt text](media/logo.png "Logo")

This is an addon that simplifies some things I commonly do in Minecraft.
It's not really meant to change the game so much as simplify the more grindy elements of the game.
## Implemented
- **Clear Function**: Run `/function clear` to remove all non-ore block in a 40x10x40 box around you.
- **Lesser Enchanting Table**: Grants low-level enchantments for 4XP levels.
- **Greater Enchanting Table**: Grants high-level enchantments for 8XP levels.
- **Arcane Enchanting Table**: Grants additional enchantments for 16XP levels.
- **Kelp Generator**: Generates kelp on event: `on_interact` and `on_fall_on`.
- **Trident Recipe**: `Tridents` are scarce early game and abundant late game. This makes them a bit easier to acquire.
- **Saddle Recipe**: `Saddles` are scarce early game (when you need them) and abundant later (when you don't).
- **Quartz Recipe**: Convert your `quartz_blocks` back into `quartz`! This was a dumb "[feature](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360043032171-Quartz-Block-to-Nether-Quartz)" anyway.
- **Creeper Spawn Egg**: Turn a mob spawner into your very own gunpowder farm.
- **Zombie Villager Spawn Egg**: Easily build your trading hall, with discounts.
- Smelt leather components down to `rabbit_hide` via furnace.
